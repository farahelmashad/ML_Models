# ðŸ§  Machine Learning : From Scratch & With scikit-learn

This repository documents my hands-on journey through machine learning. It includes **custom implementations** of ML models using only `NumPy`, as well as **practical experimentation** using popular libraries like `scikit-learn`.

The goal is to:
- âœ… Learn and implement ML algorithms from scratch including the math, intuition, and code
- ðŸ§ª Test them on real datasets
- ðŸ¤– Compare performance with `scikit-learn`
- ðŸ“Š Visualize results and understand model behavior
